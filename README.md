# pythenticate

Hobby project, simple Terminal Based OTP Authenticator written in Python.
- Currently no key to start
- Replace the key with your own (totp = pyotp.TOTP('**INSERT KEY HERE**'))
- Key is generated at time of program start, meaning there will likely be overlap where the code will not be correct as I've done no research on how standard OTP codes refresh
