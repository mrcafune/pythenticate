# pythenticate

Hobby project, simple Terminal Based OTP Authenticator written in Python.
- Current Key is random
- Replace the key with your own
- Key is generated at time of program start, meaning there will likely be overlap where the code will not be correct as I've done no research on how standard OTP codes refresh
